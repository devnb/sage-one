# Follow these steps to get this sample application running:
#
# 1. Make a copy of this file and name it `client_config.yml`.
#
# 2. Go to the Sage Developer Self Service at
#    https://developerselfservice.sageone.com/ and sign up/sign in.
#
# 3. Create a new application (app) and copy the values for Client ID and
#    Client Secret into the fields below.
#
# 4. Depending on the way you run the sample app (Docker environment,
#    local Apache, etc.) adjust the hostname/port of the callback URL
#    below. Add the same callback URL to your client application in the
#    Sage Developer Self Service.
